# Preface
Designed and Developed by JYC - Jared Yeung Creative

Welcome to my blog/personal website/portfolio, a project that I pursued for self-fulfillment. 

After seeking advice from ChatGPT and Poe [( refer to this )](https://www.jaredyeung.com/posts/hello-world-this-is-jared-yeung), I incorporated their suggestions to enhance the skills utilized in this website.

I ventured into new territory while creating this website, pushing myself to explore fresh ideas and concepts.

BTW: This repo is for my learning purpose.

This is my first time to handle ReactJS / Nextjs / Sanity CMS / JSON / API, I will try my best to make it better for disclosing the source code, and the projects.
